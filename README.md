# ontologies
The Provenance of Research Involving Social Media (PRISM) ontology is designed to support the description and sharing of provenance information about the use of social media data within research projects.  The ontology is built around descriptions how three key stages of the research process - data collection, data preparation and data analysis - were conducted.
